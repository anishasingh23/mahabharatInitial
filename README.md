# Dharmic Intelligence Platform

**Tagline:** Where epic wisdom meets modern moral dilemmas.

---

## Overview

The Dharmic Intelligence Platform is a prototype web application that maps user moral dilemmas to passages from the Mahābhārata, uses semantic search to retrieve relevant contexts, and adapts narrative-driven responses to the user's age, education level, and cultural framing.  

It is **not** here to tell you what to do. It’s here to make you pause, think, and possibly imagine what Bhishma might have said — but without the long lectures (well… mostly).
